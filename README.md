# Retrieval-Based-Chatbot-College-Project-
I created this chatbot for a college project using Tkinter, TensorFlow, NLTK and Keras.
It has it's own basic dataset.
To tun this project:
First, we train the model using the command in the terminal: 
python train_chatbot.py or py train_chatbot.py

Then to run the app, we run the second file using: 
python botgui.py or py botgui.py
